# korean-recipes 🇰🇷🍚
This is a demo website I created from scratch.

The perfect side dishes to rice--SHRIMP JEON, ACORN MOOK, and STEWED BEEF JJIM--from my mother's recipes.

Alongside culinary skills, I also learned these skills in HTML/CSS:
- HTML: boilerplate, link different pages, add images, create lists
- CSS: boilerplate, link stylesheet to html, use flexbox for better layout, different colors/fonts, use classes, crop images, edit list/link appearance.
